[00:23.00] This world's infected with your cancer, fueled by hate and greed
[00:28.61] But it's the hate it feeds, feeds the pain in me
[00:33.84] So disconnected with the rest, it takes the best of me
[00:39.50] To let the sick world breathe, this can't be good for me
[00:44.24] But I feel great
[00:52.24] 
[00:49.62] So, the time has come for you to learn your treasons
[00:55.67] The reason for your bleeding
[01:00.61] You took me away, turned me into something
[01:06.84] The light wouldn't save you, yeah
[01:23.34] 
[01:11.42] I've gone postal!
[01:14.43] With every word you say
[01:16.81] I've gone postal!
[01:20.55] You dig your grave
[01:29.55] 
[01:33.48] I hope the violence breaks the silent devil's grip on me
[01:39.00] Let the beast run free, let me be me
[01:44.08] But it's decided, they'd rather die, so get down on your knees
[01:50.08] And watch me squeeze the trigger
[02:06.08] 
[01:54.35] So, the time has come for you to learn your treasons
[02:00.24] The reason for your bleeding
[02:05.30] You took me away, turned me into something
[02:11.74] The light wouldn't save you, yeah
[02:28.24] 
[02:15.81] I've gone postal!
[02:19.10] With every word you say
[02:21.65] I've gone postal!
[02:25.02] You dig your grave
[02:34.02] 
[02:27.02] You think you're slick
[02:28.74] But everything you did was built on the back of another
[02:32.38] So fuck you
[02:33.84] Today is the first day of the end of your lives
[02:37.28] So get down if you don't wanna die
[02:40.04] I'm feeling pissed now and you're wondering why
[02:42.64] I regret nothing because you're begging to die
[02:45.39] I'm about to go postal, taking all of your lives
[03:09.39] 
[03:12.59] So, the time has come for you to learn your treasons
[03:18.45] The reason for your bleeding
[03:23.24] You took me away, turned me into something
[03:29.71] The light wouldn't save you, yeah
[03:46.21] 
[03:33.93] I've gone postal!
[03:37.26] With every word you say
[03:39.65] I've gone postal!
[03:43.46] You dig your grave
